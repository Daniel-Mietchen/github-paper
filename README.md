# Plos in Computational Biology paper related with github for researchers, code, source and document

## Descriptiopn 

The present repository contains all the documentation of the paper entitle: **"Ten Simple Rules for taking advantage of GitHub in bioinformatics"**. Our main aim here is to highlight specific GitHub features that will enable the bioinformatics community to use Gitub features and tools in a daily basics. We will then provide a set of recommendations for taking full advantage of its core features to facilitate and manage the work on a given bioinformatics project and increase its profile to the scientific community. We think the manuscript is timely due to the announcement of the closure of another widely used service, Google Code. Therefore, many of the users of Google Code will therefore have to migrate to GitHub. 


# How to contribute 

If you have an idea for a new Rule to add or change to the main manuscript or Figure, etc, it is best to communicate with main authors of the paper. The most common venues for this are GitHub issues for common specification issues (https://github.com/ypriverol/github-paper/issues). Browse through existing GitHub issues and if one seems related, comment on it. If no existing issue seems appropriate, a new issue can be opened using this form.
